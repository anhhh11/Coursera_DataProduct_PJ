Energy efficiency prediction
========================================================

Basic usage
========================================================
Following these step to predicting your house heating and cooling load
- Input all your parameters in by using slides (for example: Relative Compactness, etc.)
- You should see result on the right of screen in grey box
- Press PLOT button to see your energy efficiency comparation to overall other houses

More advanced usage
========================================================
- Summary tab show quantile of heating and loading load, you can use this results to compare your houses parameters if having some statistics knowledge.
- Training data also available in "Training data" tab, you can click and see it.

Underlying
========================================================
I use Random Forest with training data set ( you can find more info in "Data source" tab). Their performance are shown below
For Heating Load:
```{r,echo=FALSE,eps=FALSE}
#Average MSE
mean(pred_Y1$mse)
#Average RQS
mean(pred_Y1$rsq)
```
For Cooling Load:
```{r,echo=FALSE,eps=FALSE}
#Average MSE
mean(pred_Y2$mse)
#Average RQS
mean(pred_Y2$rsq)
```
Run on your own server
========================================================
- Please send me email if you need source code of project, before that make sure that you have installed following R version with all libraries which used in source code
```{r, echo}
R.version$version.string
```
